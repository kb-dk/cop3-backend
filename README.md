# cop3-backend

The COP gives backend services to frontends providing access to
digital library objects for the benefit of the patrons of the [Royal
Danish Library](https://www.kb.dk/).  this time there are two
frontends using it:

* [Danmark set fra luften](https://www.kb.dk/danmarksetfraluften/)
* [Digital Collections](http://www5.kb.dk/editions/any/2009/jul/editions/en/)

This a new and slightly more complicated version of
[cop2-backend](https://github.com/kb-dk/cop2-backend/tree/master/trunk),
or perhaps slightly less complicated. Beauty is in the eye of the
beholder.

If you have managed to find this document you are most likely a
DEVELOPER, so why not reading our [documentation for
developers](DEVELOPER.md) instead?
